Description:
<p>Index.html contains a webpage containing a short bio, contact information and few projects I've worked on.
Index.html contains the code for the main page.
Projects.html contains the code for the projects page (linked out from the main page).
Contact.html contains the code for the contact info (linked out from the main page).
Style.css contains the CSS for all 3 html docs.
The image and video referenced are saved within the "img" folder.</p>

How to Run:
<p>Load the main index.html page to display the GitHub page. Use links to navigate to projects page and respective project repositories.</p>

Roadmap to Future Improvements:
<p>May add more to the CSS styling including something to indicate which page the user is on by possibly highlighting the curent page landing on the navigation bar. Would also like to add more content and functionality.</p>
